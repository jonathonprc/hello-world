# hello-world
I am PhD candidate in the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia.
My research is focused on atmospheric response to amplified Arctic change and its consequences for the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Currently I work primarily with large geospatial datasets but I am also interested, more broadly, in data management, visualization, and interpretation.
